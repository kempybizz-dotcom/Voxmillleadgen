## üö® COMMON ISSUES

### "Invalid API Key"
- Double-check you pasted the correct key
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Verify the API is enabled in Google Cloud

### "Rate Limit Exceeded"
- The script has built-in delays
- If you still hit limits, increase sleep times in the code
- Hunter.io has monthly limits - upgrade plan if needed

### "Permission Denied" (Google Sheets)
- Make sure `credentials.json` is in the same folder
- Verify Google Sheets API is enabled
- Check service account has Editor role

### Script Crashes
- Check `voxmill_platinum.log` for detailed error
- Most crashes are from API timeouts - script will resume
- If persistent, restart from where it stopped

---

## ‚ö° OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### To Speed Up:
- Reduce cities in `UK_CITIES` list
- Reduce categories in `VOXMILL_CATEGORIES` and `AGENCY_CATEGORIES`
- Set `max_leads_per_category = 20` instead of searching all results

### To Get More Leads:
- Add more cities
- Add more categories
- Remove filtering conditions for "struggling" businesses

### To Save API Costs:
- Skip Clearbit (use free tier only)
- Skip LinkedIn scraper
- Use GPT-3.5-turbo instead of GPT-4 (line 446)
